Use time() instead of getrusage() in benchmark

Why does error on the pixel sum increase for large N? (rounding? try long double FFT?)

Is FFTW_MEASURE actually faster than ESTIMATE?

Implement AddImageNoise --> AbsImageFilter --> AbsImageWriter

Update class diagram and wiki docs

Check if the noise functor in ImageResponseModel is kept alive by assignment.
