x Check benchmark mean pixel sum against analytic calculation

x Why is benchmark RMS so small? (check random offsets?)

x Is bicubic interpolation formula correct? Need better estimate of derivatives?

Calculate chi-square over all pixels, in addition to pixel sum, as accuracy metric?

Use benchmark with more realistic RMS for individual Gaussians.

Possible to include full covariance in analytic benchmark model?

Why does error on the pixel sum increase for large N (rounding? try long double FFT?)

x Why are pixel values negative, e.g., for generate -n 5 (try generate -n 6 --midpoint with delta)

Is FFTW_MEASURE actually faster than ESTIMATE?
